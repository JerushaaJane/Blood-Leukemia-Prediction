# Blood-Leukemia-Prediction
Leukemia is overproduction of abnormal and immature white blood cells thereby damaging immune system. The typical methods like complete blood count (CBC), bone marrow aspiration for leukemia diagnosis are economical but are less reliable and time consuming and have ‘inter observer variability’. A quick, safe, and accurate early-stage diagnosis of leukemia plays a key role in curing and saving patients’ lives. A number of machine learning algorithms have been developed to identify leukemia but they end up providing high mis-classification error rate and low veracity. Conventional identification of blood disorders based on visual inspection of blood smears through microscope is time consuming, error-prone and is limited by haematologist's physical acuity. Therefore, an automated optical image processing system is required to support the clinical decision-making. The proposed system uses Convolutional Neural Network Algorithm of Deep Learning for better prediction and provide automated analysis of multi-class disease ( Blood Leukemia ). The proposed system follows a pipelined stages of  pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction, classification, leukemic stage detection, and therapeutics associated with the classified leukemia. It aims to provide increased accuracy in classification and segmentation.
